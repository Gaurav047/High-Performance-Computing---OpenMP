## Day 2 : 6th December 2019
* After a lot of effort, I finally got up at 8 AM in the morning. The first lecture on Computer Architecture was started a bit late and I regreted missing the breakfast during that time. The lecture was very short and precise introduction to hardware level Computer Architecture by Prof. Mainak Chaudhuri. 
* The next lecture was taken by Dr. Ashish Kuvelkar giving a brief introduction to the High Performance Cluster Computing and why supercomputers are used to solve a variety of problems.
* We ran for the lunch as we were running late by 30 minutes already.
* After the lunch we had a intro session to parallel computing and programming using the openMP directives ( pragma ) which was taken by Dr. Sandeep Agarwal.
* Next up after a brisk coffee session was hands-on session to openMP, in which I struggled as I couldn't pay much attention in the introductory lecture.
