## Day 1 : 5 - 12 - 2019

* I got up late in the morning at around 10 AM and missed the breakfast. After getting up at 10, I quickly brushed my teeths and washed my face to discover that I had left my towel in IIT Mandi. So, now I had to find a shop to buy a new one. I found a E-shop ( as they call it ) nearby and continuing with my badluck there was no full size towel available in the Shop, So I had to resort to a hand towel.
* Now, after a refreshing bath I went to the dining hall, had lunch at around 12:15 PM. They served Masoor Dal and Dum Aloo in the Lunch. There were a few add-ons too but I was a bit skeptical about adding extra calories to my diet.
* At around 1:30 PM, we started walking towards the Rajeev Motwani 101 Lecture Hall, it was about 1 Km away from our place of stay. It took us about 20 minutes to get to the venue.
* The session started with a small registration followed by a group photo session. Next to come up was a introductory hands-on session to the Linux Commands like scp, grep, ls, cd, mkdir, pwd etc. This was followed by an intro to the ssh and ssh clients like MobaXterm and puTTy. 
* The session ended in the evening at around 5 PM and we left for our respective halls of residence.
* Following my badluck I lost the way and had to rely on google maps to direct me towards the destination.
* Later I had a few snacks and had Dinner and then went to do something on my laptop. At around 11:55 PM, I slept hoping to get upn early before 9 AM.
