## Day 0 : 3rd and 4th February, 2019
### Travel
* From Mandi to Delhi via Bus - A very mainstream journey since I do it very frequently.
* From Delhi to Kanpur via Train : Although I booked a comfy 2nd Class AC berth, but I felt very uncomfortable because the train took 1 extra hour to reach Kanpur stopping very frequently before arriving at Kanpur. Another reason for the discomfort was the irritating green LED on the Air Conditioner which didn't let me sleep.
* Kanpur Central Railway station to IIT Kanpur Hall 9 : I hired an AutoRickshaw from the Kanpur Central Railway Station that took about an hour to reach Hall 9, IIT Kanpur. After arriving at Hall 9, I got the keys to my room (Room number H 210 ), to my surprise, the hostel didn't resemble to a purani haveli and it was quite a decent hostel with well equipped Amenities, Mess, Parks and Canteen. 
Mess food was also decent, going against the common norm of serving bad food in the hostel messes of IITs. Especially, chapatis were just like the ones you get at home, perfectly round and butter in fine amount spread over each chapati.
Here, have a look at a few pictures that I took from my phone.

* After arriving at my accomodation, I did not waste much time and I started to roam around the campus and just realized that it was the largest in terms of area amongst all the universities that I had visited till now. It was pitch black night and I moved through several Hostels, Cafeterias, Parks etc. I stopped at the SAC ( Student Activity Center ) and found it very unusual that it had a lot of cafeterias( including Dominoes ) inside unlike my college which only has space and rooms for technical and cultural clubs.
